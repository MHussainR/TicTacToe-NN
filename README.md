# TicTacToe-NN
 Implemetation of a simple Neural Network Model to play Noughts and crosses

This is a project inspired by the matchbox NN of Mr Donald Michie which he created in 1960.

For Python
The count.txt file contains the count of how many gamees have been played. The boards.txt file comtains all the board states that the program has encountered. The learn.txt has the board state and possible moves list on which it trains

For C++
ttt_ai.cpp is the main file. The boards_1.txt stores the board state and move.txt stores the possible moves on which it trains.


This project is under development. Any suggestions are appreciated.
